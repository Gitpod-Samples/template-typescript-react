# A Create React App on Gitpod

This is a [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/) template configured for ephemeral development environments on [Gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io/).

## How We Created This Example

To get started with React on Gitpod, you can use the `create-react-app`:

```bash
npx create-react-app my-app
```

Then, add a [`.gitpod.yml`](./.gitpod.yml) file which contains the configuration to improve the developer experience on Gitpod.
